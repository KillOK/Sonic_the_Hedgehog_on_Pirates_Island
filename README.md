# Sonic_the_Hedgehog_on_Pirates_Island
Decided to share my first Java game, which I wrote in far 2016...
For this project I used libGDX framework
The best thing of this framework as also java technology is that, code which you write
would work as well on android platform, as on desktop(win/linux) and IOS... 
The main requirement is support of java technology
P.S. first game, don't judge strict
